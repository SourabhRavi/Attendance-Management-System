# Attendance-Management-System-Using-Arduino-With-GUI-using-C-
This system will help the authority manage the attendance system in a more organized, efficient and time saving manner. The proposed method has been implemented in a prototype system that has proved the effectiveness of the system in easing the chores of attendance taking as a result of the automation of the system using the RFID technology. The design of the system is simple, inexpensive and portable making it a good candidate for commercial and academic purposes.
